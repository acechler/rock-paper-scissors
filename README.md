# TypeScript Boilerplate

## Introduction
This TypeScript Boilerplate provides a foundational setup for building robust web applications using TypeScript. It integrates key development tools such as Webpack for bundling, Jest for testing, and includes a configured development server for a seamless development experience.

## Setup and Installation
To get started with this boilerplate, follow the steps below to setup the project on your local machine:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://your-repository-url.git
cd typescript-boilerplate

# Install dependencies

# Project Technologies

## Frontend Technologies

- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript, which provides type safety at compile time.
- **Webpack**: Used to bundle TypeScript files and other assets. This is for building scalable applications.
- **Webpack Dev Server**: Provides a simple web server and the ability to use live reloading.
- **HTML Webpack Plugin**: This plugin simplifies the creation of HTML files to serve the webpack bundles.
- **Jest and ts-jest**: For testing JavaScript and TypeScript code.

## Backend Technologies

- **ts-node**: This runs TypeScript code directly without pre-compiling. 
- **Node.js**: Used through ts-node and webpack-dev-server.
